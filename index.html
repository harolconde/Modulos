                capable of being connected to another one in any direction<br> 
                providing you with infinite possibilities.

                We have refined a super-simple, yet absolutely stable connection<br> 
                system for the modules, which makes assembly a breeze. The only<br> 
                tool you need is a hex key - which is included in your module's<br> 
                box. Simply connect the modules with wooden pins, fasten them<br> 
                together with a simple screw system and you're ready to go! And<br> 
                the desk, of course, holds weight just as any other desk would!
